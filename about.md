title: About the Abbey
---
Atelier Abbey is a non-profit collection of like-minded Artists and Artisans that want to bring great works of visual bliss into the world. Sound too cheesy and hyperbolic? Good! Because that’s us too.

Bottom line is we love animation, game design, comics, &amp; visual development. And, we want more of it out in the world.

### To Encourage Creation

Learning how to be an artist is a journey. We’d like to help with the technical side of it because we’re on that same journey.
